# About this manual

> examples and techniques still work in newer versions, some functionality may have changed.

We encourage you to:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/GreenDelta/openLCAJython-manual/issues) if you encounter
  something that does not work or is unclear.

- Contribute improvements, fixes, or new examples. If you have built a useful script or utility with
  Jython in openLCA, others would certainly benefit from it.

- Share feedback, questions, or suggestions in the [openLCA forum](https://ask.openlca.org/).

This manual is community-driven. Your contributions‚Äîbe it fixing outdated code, adding usage tips,
or documenting common pitfalls‚Äîwill make this guide more helpful for everyone.

Feel free to fork the repository, suggest edits, or just open an issue describing what you'd like to
add or improve.
